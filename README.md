### Authentication

- Add an authorisation implementation for the JWT token that validates the token before every protected endpoint is called. If the validation fails, return a suitable error message with a corresponding HTTP status code
- Protected routes are create a blog, edit a blog, get the list of blogs, delete a blog(s)

- Set the token in request header in Postman, once validated, in the request - `x-api-key`

Example:- key :- `x-api-key`, and value/Token:- `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2NGZlMDgwZWQwNjRlMWI1MTEwN2Q3NzIiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTQzNzAxNjF9.uSQXSZBPLAy69GcE8NsDNjrRbNs0QxLkeZws7H3YnXQ` NOTE:- This token is the example of JWT token, for every user login api will create new valid token

- Used a middleware for authentication and Authorisation purpose.

### Authorisation

- Make sure that only the owner of the blogs is able to edit or delete the blog.
- In case of unauthorized access return an appropirate error message.
